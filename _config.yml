  Software engineer with 3.4 years of experience in backend development and DevOps. 
  Passionate about solving challenging problems and eager to work on impactful projects..

  For the past year, I have been focused on building intelligent, scalable chatbots that can
  be trained on custom data and integrated with leading LLM engines like OpenAI, Claude, Hugging Face,
  and Llama. Leveraging frameworks like FastAPI and Flask, along with robust databases such as MySQL
  and Redis, I have developed highly scalable and high-performance systems.

  Throughout my career, I have successfully led multiple projects from the ground up,
  utilizing AWS services (S3, SES, EC2, IAM), Docker, Nginx, uWSGI, and qb. My expertise extends
  to IoT solutions and ERP systems, where I’ve gained a strong understanding of these essential
  business tools. Additionally, I have intermediate proficiency in React with Ant Design, completing
  two projects in this space.

  As a freelancer, I have worked on diverse projects, blending technical expertise with creativity
  to deliver tailored solutions. I am passionate about solving complex problems, staying updated
  with industry trends, and delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions that drive results.
